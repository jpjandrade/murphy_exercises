Murphy's figures and exercises (in Python)
-----------------------------------------

This repository contains Python notebooks for reproducing figures and the solution for exercises 
from Kevin Murphy's Machine Learning: a Probabilistic Perspective book.

The files are divided by chapter and prefixed by the figure or exercise number. All the data used was
obtained from https://github.com/probml/pmtk3, which also includes the original MATLAB code for the figures.
