Murphy's figures and exercises (in Python)
-----------------------------------------

This repository contains Python notebooks for reproducing figures and the solution for exercises from Kevin Murphy's Machine Learning: a Probabilistic Perspective book. Some notebooks also include a somewhat self contained explanation of the tools used with references to the appropriate chapters.

The files are divided by chapter and prefixed by the figure or exercise number. Most of the data used was
obtained from https://github.com/probml/pmtk3, which also includes the original MATLAB code for the figures.
